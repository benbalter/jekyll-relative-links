# Jekyll Relative Links

A Jekyll plugin to convert relative links to markdown files to their rendered equivalents.

## What it does

Let's say you have a link like this in a markdown file:

```
[foo](bar.md)
```

While that would render as a valid link on GitHub.com, it would not be a valid link on Pages. Instead, this plugin converts that link to:

```
[foo](bar.html)
```

It even work with pages with custom permalinks. If you have `bar.md` with the following:

```
---
permalink: /bar/
---

# bar
```

Then `[foo](bar.md)` will render as `[foo](/bar/)`.

## Why

Because markdown files rendered by GitHub Pages should behave similar to Markdown files rendered on GitHub.com

## Usage

1. Add the following to your site's Gemfile:

  ```ruby
  gem 'jekyll-relative-links'
  ```

2. Add the following to your site's config file:

  ```yml
  gems:
    - jekyll-relative-links
  ```
