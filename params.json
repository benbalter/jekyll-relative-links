  "body": "# Jekyll Relative Links\r\n\r\nA Jekyll plugin to convert relative links to markdown files to their rendered equivalents.\r\n\r\n## What it does\r\n\r\nLet's say you have a link like this in a markdown file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[foo](bar.md)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile that would render as a valid link on GitHub.com, it would not be a valid link on Pages. Instead, this plugin converst that link to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[foo](bar.html)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt even work with pages with custom permalinks. If you have `bar.md` with the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n---\r\npermalink: /bar/\r\n---\r\n\r\n# bar\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen `[foo](bar.md)` will render as `[foo](/bar/)`.\r\n\r\n## Why\r\n\r\nBecause markdown files rendered by GitHub Pages should behave similar to Markdown files rendered on GitHub.com\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n1. Add the following to your site's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  gem 'jekyll-relative-links'\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n2. Add the following to your site's config file:\r\n\r\n  ```yml\r\n  gems:\r\n    - jekyll-relative-links\r\n  ```\r\n",
